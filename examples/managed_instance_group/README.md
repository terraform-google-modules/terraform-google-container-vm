# Managed Instance Group

This example illustrates how to deploy a container to a [managed instance group](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instance-groups/#managed_instance_groups) in GCP. Also includes SSH key configuration, so a user can be provisioned on the fly for future logins.

## Requirements

This example requires that some python libraries be installed, as outlined in `requirements.txt`. Depending on your environment, you should be able to run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to satisfy these requirements.

# MySQL service on Container Optimized OS

This module implements a MySQL service running as a container on one or more Container Optimized OS instances. The following resources are created and managed by this module:

* `google_compute_address`, one reserved IP address per instance
* `google_compute_disk`, one data disk per instance
* `google_compute_instance`, one or more COS instances
* `google_compute_firewall`, one firewall rule to allow traffic from specific IP ranges to the MySQL port

Variables allow controlling several aspects of the created resurces, like number of instances (`instance_count`), container image used for MySQL (`container_image`), client IP ranges allowed to connect to the service (`client_cidrs`), MySQL configuration file (`my_cnf`).

The `password` and `kms_data` in particular allow different ways of passing the MySQL root password to the container:

- through the auto-generated secret, if no password is provided
- using the provided password as is, if the `kms_data` variable is empty
- decrypting the provided password on the instance using Cloud KMS, if the `kms_data` variable contains values for the `project_id`, `keyring`, `location`, and `key` keys

KMS decryption on the instance leverages the instance service account, which needs the `roles/cloudkms.cryptoKeyDecrypter` role on the provided key. The corresponding KMS scope is added by this module to the instance scopes if a valid KMS configuration is present.

The [official Docker MySQL image](https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql) supports various customization options which are not directly implemented here, but are fairly trivial to add by modifying the `cloud-init` file set on the instance.

## Sample Usage

```hcl
module "mysql" {
  source         = "terraform-google-modules/container-vm/google//modules/cos-mysql"
  instance_count        = "1"
  project_id     = "my-project"
  region         = "europe-west3"
  zone           = "europe-west3-c"
  data_disk_size = "10"
  vm_tags        = ["ssh"]
  password       = "base64_KMS_encrypted_password"
  kms_data = {
    project_id = "my-kms-project-id"
    keyring = "my-keiring"
    key = "my-key"
    location = "europe-west3"
  }
  network        = "my-network-name"
  subnetwork     = "https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/my-project/regions/europe-west3/subnetworks/my-subnetwork"
}
```

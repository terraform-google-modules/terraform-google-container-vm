# Terraform Google Container VM Metadata Module

This module handles the generation of metadata for [deploying containers on GCE instances](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/containers/deploying-containers).

This module itself does not launch an instance or managed instance group. It simply generates the necessary metadata to create an instance or MIG yourself. Examples of using this module can be found in the [examples/](examples) directory.

## Compatibility
This module is meant for use with Terraform 0.13+ and tested using Terraform 1.0+. If you find incompatibilities using Terraform >=0.13, please open an issue.
 If you haven't
[upgraded](https://www.terraform.io/upgrade-guides/0-13.html) and need a Terraform
0.12.x-compatible version of this module, the last released version
intended for Terraform 0.12.x is [v2.0.0](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-google-modules/-container-vm/google/v2.0.0).

## Usage

```hcl
module "gce-container" {
  source = "terraform-google-modules/container-vm/google"
  version = "~> 2.0"

  container = {
    image="gcr.io/google-samples/hello-app:1.0"
    env = [
      {
        name = "TEST_VAR"
        value = "Hello World!"
      }
    ],

    # Declare volumes to be mounted.
    # This is similar to how docker volumes are declared.
    volumeMounts = [
      {
        mountPath = "/cache"
        name      = "tempfs-0"
        readOnly  = false
      },
      {
        mountPath = "/persistent-data"
        name      = "data-disk-0"
        readOnly  = false
      },
    ]
  }

  # Declare the Volumes which will be used for mounting.
  volumes = [
    {
      name = "tempfs-0"

      emptyDir = {
        medium = "Memory"
      }
    },
    {
      name = "data-disk-0"

      gcePersistentDisk = {
        pdName = "data-disk-0"
        fsType = "ext4"
      }
    },
  ]

  restart_policy = "Always"
}
```

Then perform the following commands on the root folder:

- `terraform init` to get the plugins
- `terraform plan` to see the infrastructure plan
- `terraform apply` to apply the infrastructure build
- `terraform destroy` to destroy the built infrastructure

## Container Options

Advanced container options, as described [here](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/containers/configuring-options-to-run-containers), can be passed in as part of the `container` map.

The `instance_with_advanced_options` example also demonstrates this.

```hcl
module "gce-advanced-container" {
  source = "terraform-google-modules/container-vm/google"
  version = "~> 2.0"

  container = {
    image = "busybox"
    command = [
      "tail"
    ]
    args = [
      "-f",
      "/dev/null"
    ]
    securityContext = {
      privileged : true
    }
    tty : true
    env = [
      {
        name  = "EXAMPLE"
        value = "VAR"
      }
    ]
  }

  restart_policy = "OnFailure"
}
```

## Requirements
### Terraform plugins
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) >= 0.13.0
- [terraform-provider-google](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-google) plugin v1.8.0

### Python Libraries
- [terraform_external_data](https://github.com/operatingops/terraform_external_data)

### Configure a Service Account
In order to execute this module you must have a Service Account with the following:

#### Permissions
- `compute.disks.*` on the project
- `compute.diskTypes.get` on the project
- `compute.diskTypes.list` on the project

### Enable API's
In order to operate with the Service Account you must activate the following APIs on the project where the Service Account was created:

- Compute Engine API - compute.googleapis.com

## Install

### Terraform
Be sure you have the correct Terraform version (0.10.x), you can choose the binary here:
- https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/

## File structure
The project has the following folders and files:

- /: root folder
- /examples: Examples for using this module
- /helpers: Scripts that the module invokes
- /test: Folders with files for testing the module (see Testing section of this file)
- /main.tf: main file for this module, contains all the resources to create
- /variables.tf: all the variables for the module
- /output.tf: the outputs of the module
- /readme.md: this file

## Testing

### Requirements
- [docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [terraform-docs](https://github.com/segmentio/terraform-docs/releases) 0.3.0

### Autogeneration of documentation from .tf files
Run
```
make generate_docs
```

### Integration test

#### Terraform integration tests
The integration tests for this module leverage [kitchen-terraform](https://github.com/newcontext-oss/kitchen-terraform) and [kitchen-inspec](https://github.com/inspec/kitchen-inspec), and run entirely within `docker` containers.

The tests will do the following:
- Perform `bundle install` command
  - Installs `kitchen-terraform` and `kitchen-inspec` gems
- Perform `kitchen create` command
  - Performs a `terraform init`
- Perform `kitchen converge` command
  - Performs a `terraform apply -auto-approve`
- Perform `kitchen validate` command
  - Performs inspec tests.
    - Shell out to `gcloud` to validate expected resources in GCP.
    - Log into deployed resources to validate Docker configuration.
    - Make HTTP requests to endpoints that are expected to be online.
- Perform `kitchen destroy` command
  - Performs a `terraform destroy -force`

Before running integration tests, you need to configure `terraform.tfvars` for your particular environment editing `test/fixtures/shared/terraform.tfvars` to reflect your testing environment.

You can then use the following command to run the integration test in the root folder

  `make test_integration_docker`

### Linting
The makefile in this project will lint or sometimes just format any shell,
Python, golang, Terraform. The linters will only be run if
the makefile finds files with the appropriate file extension.

All of the linter checks are in the default make target, so you just have to
run

```
make -s
```

The -s is for 'silent'. Successful output looks like below and exists with 0 exit code.

```
$ make -s

Initializing provider plugins...

The following providers do not have any version constraints in configuration,
so the latest version was installed.

To prevent automatic upgrades to new major versions that may contain breaking
changes, it is recommended to add version = "..." constraints to the
corresponding provider blocks in configuration, with the constraint strings
suggested below.

* provider.external: version = "~> 1.2"
* provider.google: version = "~> 2.12"

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.

## Known limitations
Managed instance group [example](examples/managed_instance_group/main.tf) is not migrated to Terraform 0.12
This is tracked as issue [`#28`](https://github.com/terraform-google-modules/terraform-google-container-vm/issues/28)
Linters and integrations tests skip this example and associated tests for now.
